use python -m bot
python -O -m bot for prod
I could probably make this into a .bat
maybe later

Make sure to install all the requirement.txt !!
you can pip install them manually or use a docker to auto-install
pterodactyl is the docker used to test this project

Looks for a .env formatted in the following way at bot/.env
API_KEY = Your_Discord_API_Key_here
BSuser = Your_Bluesky_User_here
BSpass = Your_Bluesky_Pass_here
